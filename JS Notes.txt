Type Coercion converts different data types to same 
	and then try to compare them (using == OR !=)
	but if you dont want this to happen, use strict
	Equality (=== OR !==) This doesnt do the type
	coercion thingy.

numVar.tofixed(2)-> Fixes decimal point to 2

Parameter VS Arguments
	 A parameter is always going to be a variable name and appears in the function declaration
	 an argument is always going to be a value (i.e. any of the JavaScript data types - a number, a string, a boolean, etc.) and will always appear in the code when the function is called or invoked.
	 
Variable assignments are not hoisted.

Function Expressions are variables that store functions within them.
	Function Expressions aren't hoisted

A function that is passed into another function is called a callback

Splice() in array -
	The first argument represents the starting index from where you want to change the array, the second argument represents the numbers of elements you want to remove, and the remaining arguments represent the elements you want to add.

	var donuts = ["glazed", "chocolate frosted", "Boston creme", "glazed cruller"];
	onuts.splice(1, 1, "chocolate cruller", "creme de leche");

Array.forEach
	can have two or more variables oe is index also
	test.forEach(function(num, index){
    if(num%3===0){
        test[index]=num+=100
    }
	})
